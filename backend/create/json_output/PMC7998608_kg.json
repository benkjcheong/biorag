    "title": "Therapeutic effects of adult stem-cell transplantations are limited by poor cell-retention in target organs, and a reduced potential for optimal cell differentiation compared to embryonic stem cells. However, contemporary studies have indicated heterogeneity within adult stem-cell pools, and a novel culturing technique may address these limitations by selecting those for cell proliferation which are highly functional.",
